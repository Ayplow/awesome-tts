# Awesome Tabletop Simulator

This is a list of useful tools and assets for Tabletop Simulator, also to be used for planning of tools.
I'm kinda just stealing the 'awesome' format as an excuse for putting together everything we would recommend for starting modding.

## Modding tools

- [ge_tts](https://gitlab.com/BenjaminDobell/ge_tts/) - A collection of small libraries for mods
- [tts-proxy](https://github.com/Benjamin-Dobell/tts-proxy) - A heroku app for proxying web requests into standard HTTP.
- [lua-compile](https://gitlab.com/MoreThanTom/lua-compiled-require) - A compiler for multi-file lua projects.
- [Enhanced Moonsharp](https://github.com/Benjamin-Dobell/moonsharp) - A version of moonsharp for debugging TTS mods.
